Within this project, users will encounter a variety of captivating challenges, from arranging facial features to solving mazes and dynamic puzzles. The theme revolves around fostering creativity and problem-solving skills, encouraging users to navigate through each mini-game intuitively. Without explicit instructions, the objective is to prompt spontaneous exploration, allowing users to discover the rules and mechanics organically.
